This repository contains a Python program that calculates averages from user input. The original code has a bug in its error handling: when an invalid input is encountered, it skips the current number but still appends 0 to the averages list, affecting the final result. The bug is demonstrated in 'bug.py', and the corrected version is in 'bugSolution.py'. The bug is in the error handling where it adds 0 to averages instead of skipping that index.
